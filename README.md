The Aimeos web shop components can integrate into almost any PHP application and uses the infrastructure of the application for building URLs, caching content, configuration settings, logging messages, session handling, sending e-mails or handling translations.

The ai-laravel extension integrates Aimeos into the Laravel framework and utilizes the native Laravel components for content caching, logging messages, session handling, generating URLs and accessing the user table.

If you are using the Laravel framework, you don't have to install and set up the ai-laravel extension yourself. Instead, use the [Aimeos Laravel package](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-laravel) to create a web shop within minutes.
